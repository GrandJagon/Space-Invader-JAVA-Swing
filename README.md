This software is developed using the Java's Swing library for educational purpose.
All the resources are stored in the "images" folder, they are copyriht free.
As this game is not intended to be an actual game it is really short and have no many options. I intended to make it longer
with more options but I got bored at the end and decided to go for something else. However this is possible to the user to create
his own levels by choosing what enemies are displayed at what time, to do it please follow the instructions below :

.Open the text file "waves.txt" in the folder "images".
.This file contains the original waves of enemies in the format "type of enemy - starting horizontal coordinate" with each
enemy of the wave separate by a slash. For example the first wave of enemies contains four type a enemies starting respectively
at the horizontal pixels 200 , 350, 500, 650.
.Each new line is a new wave, it is possible to the user to add as many as he wants.
.There is 4 different types of enemies from a to d with the diffculty increasing from one to another.
.The user just has to modify this text file as he wants to




Enjoy
